Contribution are always welcome and much appreciated!

The development of `auditor-bundle` is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/DamienHarper/auditor-bundle).

## Requirements
Before starting to contribute, you first need to install dev dependencies:

```bash
composer install --dev
```

Also, in an effort to maintain an homogeneous code base, we strongly encourage contributors
to run [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) and [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)
before submitting a Pull Request.


## Coding standards
Coding standards are enforced using [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer)

```bash
composer csfixer
```


## Static code analysis
Static code analysis can be achieved using [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)

```bash
composer phpstan
```


## Running Tests
The test suite is configured to use an SQLite in-memory database and generates
a code coverage report in `tests/coverage` folder.


### Default configuration (SQLite)
This configuration uses an in memory SQLite database and generates code coverage report
in `tests/coverage` folder (requires [PCOV extension](https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov)).

```bash
composer test
```
