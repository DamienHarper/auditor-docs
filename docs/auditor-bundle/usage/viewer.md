`auditor-bundle` provides a built in viewer letting you review the full history of any audited entity. 
It is [disabled](../usage/enabling-disabling-at-runtime.html#at-runtime-enabledisable) by default but 
can easily be enabled in the configuration file and can be accessed by browsing to `/audit`.
